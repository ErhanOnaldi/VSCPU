Simple CPU Design with Memory Architecture

This project encompasses a simple CPU design implemented in Verilog, along with memory architecture. With communication established between these two components, the project aims to execute basic instructions effectively.

Project Objectives:

CPU Design with Verilog: The project includes the design of a simple CPU in Verilog. This design covers basic processing units and control circuits.

Memory Architecture: A memory architecture is also included in the project to communicate with the CPU. Memory is used for storing data and instructions, providing the necessary information for the CPU to operate.

Execution of Basic Instructions: The project aims to execute basic instructions of the CPU (e.g., load, store, arithmetic operations) effectively. This aims to validate that the Verilog design works correctly and provides the expected functionality of the CPU.

Installation and Usage:

Clone the project's GitHub repository.
Install the necessary software tools and simulation environments(or just use EDAplayground mine is: https://edaplayground.com/x/G8tp).
Compile the Verilog files and run them in the simulation environment.
Verify that the CPU design and memory architecture work correctly.
